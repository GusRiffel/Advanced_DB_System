# Advanced_DB_System

Website developed to fulfil the advanced database system assessment. The assessment required some ideia to help solve a problem faced in real life. I decided to create a website called ParkHeroes where people can meet up to help clean it.

Using EJS template engine to create a website with the help of node.js+express. The work was also hosted at Heroku for a short period of time.
The website runs with node.js backend and front end and uses mongoDb to store data. A MVC concecpt was followed to structure the project.
